This is just a repository for random projects which I feel like they would be nice for the world to see.

# Html Previewer
https://williek11.github.io/htmlpreview.html

A project where you can add all the HTML you would ever want in the link. It's nothing too much, but I thought it were a nice addition to the web.
The way in which you add HTML is putting a questionmark at the end and inserting the HTML (?HTML).
There are also built-in little styles that are convenient to have; instead of putting ?HTML to the end of the link, you put ?type:Type:HTML

Currently, three types are available; fonts, clean, and styleless.
Fonts add a font-family between the most widely available. They are choosen between Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, and Trebuchet MS.
Clean removes margin and padding of html and body tags.
Styleless removes margin, padding, border and background, and unsets width and height of all elements; giving you the choice of styling them all.

You can put multiple of them; just separate them with & (fonts&clean&styleless)

It will be buggy, so be aware of that. Known bugs include html tag styling and data properties being lost, script tags being weird, and possibly other unknown bugs.

# Local Notes
https://williek11.github.io/localNotes.html

A little project I'm working on that you can add notes to that intends on using your device's storage and power to make it work, instead of hundreds and hundreds of servers. With this project, I am looking forward to improve myself upon:
* General coding skills and best-practices
* Knowledge upon IndexedDB, which will come in handy instead of using LocalStorage, which although has a more than adequate amount of storage for most purposes, will be so that your notes are pretty much limitless.
* CSS knowledge
* PWAs knowledge, which will help the app be loaded even when off-line

And as for the project, the following will soon be added:

* Create your own notes (duh)
* CSS improvement (what is a good website without good visual aspects?)
* Make it work off-line
* Make it downloadable
* Simple markup language -->
