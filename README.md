This is just a repository for random projects I might want to check on in the future.

# Text Reader
You type file name. You put text in file. You download file. You insert file. Your file's contents get console logged.

# HTML Previewer
You put HTML in link. HTML runs. Happy.

# Canvas Text Editor
A text editor. What is different from literally any text editor you've seen so far? It's in canvas 2d. Why would you use it in a project since you have HTML5 and tons of libraries? Hmm, good question.
