A repository for random projects which I feel like they would be nice for the world to see.

# HtmlPreviewer
A project where you can add all the HTML you would ever want in the link. It's nothing too much, but I thought it were a nice addition to the web.
The way in which you add HTML is putting a questionmark at the end and inserting the HTML.
There are also built-in little styles that are convenient to have; instead of putting ?[HTML] to the end of the link, you put ?type:[Type]:[HTML]

Currently, three types are available; fonts, clean, and styleless.
Fonts add a font-family between the most widely available. They are choosen between Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, and Trebuchet MS.
Clean removes margin and padding of html and body tags.
Styleless removes margin, padding, border and background, unsets width and height and sets display to block to all elements; giving you the choice of styling them all.

It will be buggy, so be aware of that. Known bugs include html tag styling and data properties being lost, script tags being weird, and possibly other unknown bugs.
